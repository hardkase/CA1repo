*START*
After weeks of daring yourself, you head off to the Cromwell Mansion. 
It is a deserted ruinous edifice, with many a broken window and a 
plethoraof missing roof tiles. Of course, you choose to do this at night. 
You feel a sense of foreboding as you wade through the sea of weeds that used
to be the mansions front garden. As you reach the door, and turn the handle,
the door opens on rusty hinges in an eery fashion, almost inviting you in.
*END*
You leave the way you entered, if more rapidly, with your treasure intact. 
The vase will fetch thousands, maybe even millions at auction. As you quickly wade 
back through the weeds towards your own dilapidated home, you catch your toe on an
old paving stone, and fall face first into another paving stone, knocking yourself
unconscious. You wake several minutes later, with a throbbing face and blood gushing
from your nose. You find the vase, or what's left of it, shattered into a thousand 
pieces. You've learned an important lesson: go carefully when escaping a creepy 
mansion with a priceless and delicate artifact.
