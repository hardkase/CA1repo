Mummification Chamber
This large vaulted room with a central raised slab must be where the Pharoah was mummified. Broken jars litter the floor. A hole in the west wall and a passage to the east lead out of the room.

Slave Tomb
Stepping through the dark hole in the wall, your foot crunches loudly. You're stepping on bones. This must have been where the slaves were walled in to join the Pharoah in eternity. A cold chill runs down your spine.
